## FAQ
Q: Does this conflict with FVM?

A: No. jvm is designed to work alongside FVM. It configures Java per-project the same way FVM configures Flutter, without interfering with global tools.

Q: Does it modify global environment variables?

A: No. All configuration is scoped to the project directory. It modifies only .jvm, .jvmrc, and gradle.properties.

Q: Where are Java versions stored?

A: Under ~/.jvm/versions/<version>
